\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This thesis would never have been possible without the support and assistance of numerous people. In fact it wasn't even planned to be 
finished at all. Strictly speaking, Maarten Steinbuch persuaded me with his irresistible negotiation skills in about fifteen minutes for 
finishing the thesis during a casual chat that took place in a colloquium (for the record, there were drinks involved too). 
I owe him much more than this manuscript for his generous support and pragmatic approach to idealism (and making it look like not a 
contradiction). There are not many of his kind in the academic circles who can tell the difference between a proof and a solution.

I would like to thank also to my thesis committee members especially for daring to get to the bottom of this rather unconventional text. 

I was supposed to finalize this thesis under DCSC, \textsf{TUDelft} affiliation. But it did not quite happen that way. Nevertheless I would like to 
thank Carsten W. Scherer for giving me the chance to work in this project and his guidance during his time in DCSC. 

Now the difficult part; I don't know how to sum up the list of people whom I have become friends with, enjoyed their company and benefited 
from their support. After scratching many versions, this is what I decided to do, so here we go; Nazl\i\space who always managed to find a 
way to make me do things right with her love and unparalleled optimism towards life, the people in DCSC, I wish the best for 
all of you (if you know what I mean), the people in CST, for your spirit and comfortable environment, C\'{e}sar L\'{o}pez for helping 
me taming the experimental setup and for our technical discussions, the best secretariat in the world ever: Kitty, Esther, Saskia, Ellen 
in DCSC and Geertje and Petra in CST, the Delft Haptics Lab people for the fun, dudes of the \enquote{pimientos} gang for the beerwatch 
nights (often, judging by its residents, in the most unfortunately named \enquote{Tango}), Rotterdam tayfas\i, Delft tayfas\i, my awesome 
band Bike2Rome, my inmates from Koornmarkt 42 for all the occasions which, for \enquote{some} reason, I cannot remember much (for example 
how a full-size table-tennis table ended up in my room), my veteran DTXpress III whereever you are now, all the nice people in 
\href{http://tex.stackexchange.com}{\TeX-SX}, thank you very much indeed. 

It goes without saying that I am grateful to mom and dad for being who they are. I am still amazed how they can contain their patience and 
understanding no matter how crazy stuff I come up with; \enquote{\emph{Hocam, sizin o\u{g}lan neden b\"{o}yle?}}
