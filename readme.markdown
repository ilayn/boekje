# The thesis progress

This is my thesis. It is an academic study. Actually a very opinionated study.
In fact it is a very very very opinionated study. Because most of the opinions 
stated here have been distilled from reading lots of junk papers, they are not 
just personal frustrations but actual arguments.

Since it is an academic research it has been made open. The actual technical code 
is not provided because it is being ported to Python as a complete toolbox. I have 
no idea whether I would finish it but certainly it will not be related to matlab 
other than reading and writing .mat files.
