# The thesis progress

This is my thesis. It is an academic study. Actually a very opinionated study.
In fact it is a very very very opinionated study and I don't care too much 
about what you think of it. Because most of the opinions stated here have been 
distilled from reading lots of junk papers. So they are not just personal frustrations 
but actual arguments. So don't send me rants of how I lack the respect etc. 

Since it is an academic research it has been made open. The actual numerical code 
is not provided because it is being ported to Python as a complete toolbox. But I have 
no idea whether I would finish it soon. Current focus is getting a primitive LMI parser-solver
in Python.
