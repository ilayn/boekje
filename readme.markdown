# The thesis progress

This is my thesis. It is an academic study. Actually a very opinionated study.
In fact it is a very very very opinionated study and I don't care too much 
about what you think of it. Because most of the opinions stated here have been 
distilled from reading lots of junk papers. So they are not just personal frustrations 
but actual arguments.

Since it is an academic research it has been made open. The actual technical code 
is not provided because it is being ported to Python as a complete toolbox. I have 
no idea whether I would finish it but certainly it will not be related to matlab 
other than reading and writing .mat files.

## Plagiarism

Well, as Will Robertson put nicely, Ha! If you are here reading this thesis, actually
paying attention and finding valuable material to plagiarise then my mission is
accomplished. Do whatever you want, I will be happy to see the academic life rot faster.
