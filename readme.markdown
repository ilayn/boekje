# PhD thesis

This is the source code of my thesis.  It is almost fully compilable except a few data files for figures (let me know if you need them). The actual numerical code written in MATLAB is not provided but probably I can send it to you if I dig up the old files. I am currently building up a Python control systems toolbox ( [GitHub link](https://github.com/ilayn/harold) ). When that matures enough the thesis results will be published in that format. 


Current focus is getting a primitive LMI parser-solver in Python and solving synthesis problems in pure Python3.
