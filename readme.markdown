# The thesis progress

This is my thesis. It is an academic study. Actually a very opinionated study.
In fact it is a very very very opinionated study. Because most of the opinions stated 
here have been distilled from reading lots of junk papers, they are not just personal frustrations 
but actual arguments which received only emotional so far. So don't send me rants of how I lack the respect for science etc. 

Since it is an academic research it has been made open. The actual numerical code 
is not provided because it is being ported to Python as a complete toolbox. But I have 
no idea whether I would finish it soon. Current focus is getting a primitive LMI parser-solver
in Python.

Stealing is allowed but getting caught is not. At least do that much right.
And of course the usual terms apply; "don't be an asshole".
